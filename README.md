# Monitoring Social Distancing
<p>
   Social distancing, also called ‚Äúphysical distancing,‚Äù means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household. To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms' length) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
  </p>

# Project Description
<p>
   To ensure Social Distancing in Public place, I‚Äôll develop a social distancing monitoring tool that will help to see if people are keeping a safe distance or not in real-time. This tool will detect humans from a video source using YOLO and then using OpenCV to show if a person is at Low, High, or Not at Risk.

> This Project is an real time application of Computer Vision
> and is implemented using opencv library in python.
> To make it better i have used two pre-trained YOLO model for
> this project.

        -  yolov3
        -  yolov3-tiny
        
         
        
> YoloV3 outperformed.
